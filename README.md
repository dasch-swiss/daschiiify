# daschiiify
The purpose of this repository is to develop a script that can generate [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) resources for DaSCH - Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities leveraging the [iiif-prezi3 Python library](https://iiif-prezi.github.io/iiif-prezi3/). 

The idea is to upgrade the [experimental and outdated IIIF Manifests feature](https://docs.dasch.swiss/2023.02.02/DSP-API/03-endpoints/api-v2/reading-and-searching-resources/#iiif-manifests).

As a first experiment, IIIF Manifests have been created for the [Bernoulli-Euler Online (BEOL)](https://ark.dasch.swiss/ark:/72163/1/0801) project.
